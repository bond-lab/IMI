<h2><a name="instructions">Tagging Instructions</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Before beginning tagging you should:
    <ul>
      <li>Read the full tagging documentation
      <li>Read the text you will be tagging (at least in the language you will be tagging)
      <li>Read the description of <a href='#prep'>how the data is prepared</a>
    </ul>
  <li>Then you tag the document:
    <ul>
      <li>Click on an untagged word: <span class='notag'>untagged</span>
      <li>It will be presented in red, with some context above and below
      <li>Wordnet senses will be displayed in the top right hand corner
      <li>Look at the tag alternatives at the bottom of the tagging screen
      <li>If it is a multi-word expression, there may be multiple choices
	<ul>
	  <li>Click the lemma in the lower left to see the senses for each choice
	  <li>Choose the correct tag for each choice (click the radio button) 
	  <li>You can also add a comment in the comment box 
	</ul>
      <li>Clicking the tag will commit your choice
      <li>Repeat until done
	<ul>
	  <li> Tagged words are shown as such: <span class='hastag'>tagged</span>
	  <li> You can click on them to retag them if you change your mind
	  <li> Words you probably don't need to tag are shown
	    in <span class='ignore'>dark grey</span>.
	  <li> Words tagged as errors  tag are shown like <span class='error'>thisss</span>. 
	</ul>
      <li> You can stop tagging at any time, and resume again later.
      <li> The interface has only been fully tested under firefox and chrome. Other browsers may behave strangely. 
    </ul>
  <li>After everyone has tagged, you can compare your tags with one or more classmate(s)   (Project 2)
    <br>The alignment tool will show the results
    <br>You then do a final round of tagging
    <ul>
      <li>Discuss your annotations with the other annotators
      <li>Anywhere where you agreed is fine
      <li>Anywhere where there was no clear majority tag should be retagged
      <li>You should add comments for at least 5 interesting examples
    </ul>
  <!-- <li>You then write up your results. -->
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name='prep'>How the data is prepared</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Wordnets are made in a variety of ways, you should read the papers
    describing the wordnet you are using.
  <li>The texts
  are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_boundary_disambiguation'>segmented
  into sentences</a>, and hand-checked.
  <li>They are then 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_%28lexical_analysis%29'>tokenized</a> into words and 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation'>lemmatized</a>.  For example:
    <ul>
      <li><i>The snow-covered men saw the does off.</i>
	<table>
	  <tr>
	    <th>word</th>
	    <td>The</td> 
	    <td>snow</td> 	    
	    <td>-covered</td> 
	    <td>men</td>
	    <td>saw</td> 
	    <td>the</td> 
	    <td>does</td> 
	    <td>off</td> 
	    <td>.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>pos</th>
	    <td>DET</td> 
	    <td>NOUN</td> 	    
	    <td>ADJ</td> 
	    <td>NOUN</td> 	    
	    <td>VERB</td> 
	    <td>DET</td> 
	    <td>NOUN</td> 
	    <td>PRT</td> 
	    <td>.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <th>word</th>
	    <td>The</td> 
	    <td>snow</td> 	    
	    <td>covered</td> 
	    <td>man</td>
	    <td>see</td> 
	    <td>the</td> 
	    <td>doe</td> 
	    <td>off</td> 
	    <td>.</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
    </ul>
  <li>This process gets it wrong 5-10% of the time
    (e.g. lemmatizing <i>saw</i> as <i>saw</i> or <i>does</i>
    as <i>do</i>).
  <li>Next, we attempt to look up the words in the wordnet, including
    multi-word expressions.  If a word is in wordnet, then we make it
    a candidate, even if the POS suggests it should not be tagged, as
    we do not fully trust the POS tag.  If a word is not in wordnet, but
    is open class (NOUN, ADJ, ADV, VERB, PRON, NUM) we add it as a
    concept.  By default, we do not add prepositions, conjunctions,
    punctuation or determiners.
  <li>Finally, there are some words that we strongly expect to be
  false candidates (<i>a</i> as a determiner, <i>be</i> preceding a
  participle (<i>be sleeping</i>).  We pre-tag these as <b>x</b>.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2><a name='tags'>Word Senses and Tags</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If the word has been lemmatized correctly, and it is an open class word and there is an appropriate sense in wordnet:
  <ul>
    <li> Select the appropriate sense: <strong><i>0, 1, …, n</i></strong> 
      <br>Use various strategies to try to rule out senses. If one
      sense is very general and another very specific, then you want
      to assign the more specific sense, so long as it applies. Try
      using the hypernym of the gloss (if it defines a noun or
      verb). Try using the semantic relations of the different senses
      (click on the sense number to look them up).  If the context is
      vague and does not clearly rule out sense(s), then you can
      comment on this.  There may be information about the information
      about the argument structure (does it have 1,2 or 3 arguments: v1, v2 or v3).
    <li> This is the preferred outcome: be a little forgiving in interpreting the definition
    <li>Feel free to add a comment at any time
    <li>Sometimes there are multiple senses that seems similar but
    differ in part-of-speech: try to chose the appropriate pos
      <table>
	<tr><th>WN POS</th><th>name</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
	<tr><td>n</td><td><b>N</b>oun</td><td>dog, me, smiling</td></tr>
	<tr><td>v</td><td><b>V</b>erb</td><td>smile, look up</td></tr>
	<tr><td>a</td><td><b>A</b>djective</td><td>quick, warm, many</td></tr>
	<tr><td>r</td><td>Adve<b>r</b>b</td><td>quickly, most, un-[clasp]</td></tr>
	<tr><td>x</td><td>Other</td><td>Hello, Thank you</td></tr>
      </table>
      <ul>
	<li>You can see the pos predicted by the POS tagger by mousing over the word to be tagged.
	  FIXME: also show UPOS?
	<li>Sense that agree with the POS tagger's tag are shown in red. FIXME
	<li>In the wordnet viewer you can make it show only ALL or only one of the POSs by clicking on:
	   <br>All    N   V   A   R
	<li>There is more discussion about POS issues in the language specific guidelines
      </ul>
    <li>If there are to many senses you can filter them by:
      <ul>
	<li>Clicking on the POS
	<li>Clicking on the individual senses to hide them (and then on the POS or All to show it again)
	  FIXME: not naming the sense properly
      </ul>
  </ul>
<li>If it is a name (or part of a name) chose an appropriate name tag:
  <ul>
    <li><b>per</b> person
      <br>e.g. <i>Irene</i> or <i>Irene Adler</i> (tag both Irene and Adler as <b>per</b>)
    <li><b>org</b> organization
      <br>e.g. <i>Scotland Yard</i>
    <li><b>dat</b> date/time
      <br>e.g. <i>the 31st, 2 o'clock, 2pm, Aug 8</i>.
    <li><b>loc</b> location
      <br>e.g. <i>Riding Thorpe Manor; Norfolk; Baker Street</i>
    <li><b>oth</b> any other proper name
      <br>e.g. <i>Samsung Galaxy SII</i>
    <li><b>year</b> year
      <br>e.g. <i>1984</i>
  </ul>
  See <a href='#ne'>Named Entities</a> for more detail
  
<li>If there is an error in the corpus (such as tokenization, lemmatization or spelling)
  <br> tag as <strong>e</strong>
   <ul>
    <li> <i><u>今</u> 日</i> should be 今日 <i>kyou</i> "today"
    <li> <i><u>three-toed</u></i> should be  <i>three</i> <i>-</i> <i>toed</i>
    <li> <i><u>does</u></i> is analysed as  <i>doe+s</i> not <i>do+es</i>
   </ul>
   Give comments about what it should be in the comment box
<li>If there is an error in the wordnet (missing sense or concept)
<br> tag as <strong>w</strong>
  <ul>
    <li> Describe the new case in the comment box (see <a href='#change'>Suggesting changes to wordnet</a>)
      <ul>
	<li> <i>I <u>arrowed</u> them</i> meaning "gave them the unpleasant job"
	<li> <i>I program in <u>python</u></i> meaning "the computer language"
      </ul>
    <li> If the same thing occurs multiple times, you only need to add
    a comment to the first occurrence
  </ul>
<li>If you think there is no need to tag the word
<br> tag as <strong>x</strong>
<br> Some examples:
  <ul>
    <li>Closed class part of speech that shouldn't be tagged
       <ul>
	<li> <i>Fred <u>is</u> swimming</i>; <i>Fred <u>has</u> swum</i>: we don't tag auxiliary <i>be</i> or <i>have</i>
	  <br>But we do tag copula
	  <i>But maybe you <u>are</u> the surgeons</i> <a  href='http://172.21.174.40/ntumc/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?gridmode=ntumc-noedit&synset=02616386-v'>'be identical to'</a>
	<li> <i>I looked <u>up</u> the stairs</i>: we don't tag normal prepositions.
	<!-- <li> <i><u>OMG!</u></i>: we don't tag exclamatives -->
      </ul>
      Note that we differ from the standard wordnet by including <b>pronouns</b> (see <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/theses.html#Seah:2013'>Yu Jie Seah (2013)</a>) and <b>Exclamatives</b>
    <br>But <b>NOT</b> structural pronouns (tag with <b>x</b>)
      <ul>
	<li> Dummy <i>it</i>: <i><u>It</u> is raining</i>;
	<li> Existential <i>there</i>: <i><u>There</u> seems to be a problem</i>;
	<li> Relative pronouns: <i>The book <u>which</u> I bought</i>;
      </ul>
    <li> Bad multi-word expression
      <ul>
	<li>  <strong>If the wrong lemma is multi-word</strong> (<i>kick_the_bucket</i>): 
	  <ul>
	    <li> e.g. <i>In the dark, I <u>kicked the bucket</u> and hurt my toe</i> not "die"
	    <li>In this case mark <i>kick_the_bucket</i> as <b>x</b> and tag <i>kicked</i> and <i>bucket</i>
	  </ul>
	<li>  <strong>If the wrong lemma is single word</strong> (<i>kick</i>):  
	  <ul>
	    <li> e.g. <i>My pet snail <u>kicked</u> the bucket so I buried it</i> not "hit with foot"
	    <li>In this case tag <i>kick_the_bucket</i> and mark <i>kicked</i> and <i>bucket</i> as <b>x</b> 
	  </ul>
	<li> Even for  (<strong>compositional</strong> multi-word expressions) just tag the largest expressioin:
	  <br> <i>I sent him the <u>source code</u></i> "program instructions ..."
	  <br> <i>I sent him the source <u>code</u></i> "the symbolic arrangement of data or instructions in a computer ..." 
	  <br> In this case you just have to tag the larger expression
	  (tag the parts with <b>x</b>: no need to tag)
      </ul>
  </ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> You must always check one of these choices!
<li> Please also mark bad entries 
  <ul>
    <li> <tt>This lemma should <b>NOT</b> be in 012345678-x</tt>
      <br> e.g., <tt>运弓法 "archery" should not be in 07274425-n bowing</tt>
  </ul>
<li>You can also add other comments, like:
  <tt>I can't really decide between 012345678-x and 012345678-y</tt>
</ul>

<h3><a name='anot'>Holmesian Annotation</a></h3>

<p>If we want to write something about a word or sentence in the style
  of Holmesian Annotation, then start the annotation with 'ANOT: '.
  E.g.
  <p> sid 48800 "Sufficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof, but I
    hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.'"
    <br>Sentence comment = "ANOT: A reference to Mathew 6:34 "Take
    therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take
    thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the
    evil thereof.""
    <br>Note: students cannot write sentence comments at present, but
    can mention it in their reports or add it to a word.


<h3><a name='ne'>Named Entities</a></h3>
<li>If it is a name (or part of a name) chose an appropriate name tag:
  <ul>
    <li><b>per</b> person
      <br>e.g. <i>Irene</i> or <i>Irene Adler</i> (tag both Irene and Adler as <b>per</b>)
    <li><b>org</b> organization
      <br>e.g. <i>Scotland Yard</i>
    <li><b>dat</b> date and or time
      <br>e.g. <i>the 31st, 2 o'clock, 2pm, Aug 8</i>.
      <br>for <i>8 pm</i> tag as number (for 8) and (post-meridian)
      for pm
    <li><b>loc</b> location
      <br>e.g. <i>Riding Thorpe Manor; Norfolk; Baker Street</i>
    <li><b>oth</b> any other proper name
      <br>e.g. <i>Samsung Galaxy SII</i>
    <li><b>year</b> year
      <br>e.g. <i>1984</i>
  </ul>

  <p>We sometimes create named entities in order to match across
  languages, although we do not expect to keep them in the wordnet. 

  <p>These are tagged as <b>notag</b> in SemCor.

<hr>
<h3><a name="change">Suggesting changes to wordnet<a> (tag
      with <strong>w</strong>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If it can be tagged with an existing synset (preferred)
    <ul>
      <li> write in the comments something like:
	<tt>This lemma is a synonym of 012345678-x</tt>
	<br>e.g. for <i>laidback<sub>u</sub></i>, it is a synonym of
	"02408011-a: laid-back, mellow", so we
	add <tt>synonym of  02408011-a</tt> in the comment
    </ul>
  <li>If you need to suggest a new synset (there is no appropriate
    concept in wordnet), then, in the comments, you need to:

	<ul>
	  <li> Write <tt>This lemma is a hyponym/instance of 012345678-x</tt>
	    <br> <i>python<sub>s</sub></i> is a hyponym of 
	    "06898352-n programming language", 
	  <li> you may mention other relations:
	    <br> <tt>This lemma is an antonym  of 012345678-x</tt>
	    <br> <tt>This lemma is related in some way to 012345678-x</tt>
	    <br> <tt>This lemma is in the domain of computing</tt>
	  <li>You should also give a definition, and ideally an example:
	    <pre>
	      Lemma: arrow (Singapore English)
	      This is a hypernym of 012345678-x
	      Def:    "To assign a task to someone. Generally used only if the task is unpleasant or boring."
	      Ex:     "They come and arrow me type their document"
	    </pre>
	    If you are not working in English, please give a
	    definition in both English and the language you are
	    working in.
	</ul>
	<li> If this word comes up multiple times, you only need to
	give detailed comments in the first instance.  After then,
	  just say <i>see earlier comments</i>

	<li>If the missing entry is a <b><a name="newMWE">multi-word
	expression</a></b>, then mark each word
	with <strong>w</strong> and put the suggestions for the synset
	in the first word.  For example: <i> you see that we
	    have <u>cut it rather fine</u></i>.
	  <br>Tag  <i>cut</i>, <i>it</i> and <i>fine</i>
	  with <strong>w</strong>, and add information to  <i>cut</i>:
	  <br>lemma: <i>cut it fine</i>, <i>cut things fine</i>;
	  definition: "to allow very little time for something, ...
	  
	<li>If you are authorized to make changes to wordnet directly,
	  <a href='#extend'>see below</a>
</ul>


<h4><a name="metaphor">Tagging Metaphorical Uses<a></h4>	

<p>If you think that a word is being used in a metaphorical sense, but
  it is not established enough to be in wordnet, then tag with the
  closest literal sense, and add "METAPHOR" in the comments.  If there
  is a good synset for the metaphorical use, then also note that
  "METAPHOR: 12345678-x".

<h3><a name="fw">Tagging Foreign Words<a></h3>

Example: 
<i>At the end of the day, Muslims break their fast (<b>buka puasa</b>) with 
a communal meal at home or at the mosque.</i>

<p>Regardless of the tag they may currently have (i.e. likely 'e' or 'w'),
foreign words (like 'buka puasa', above) should be tagged with the 
synset that corresponds to that concept in the corresponding language.</p>

<p>In this case, we don't want to add  'buka puasa' to the English wordnet.
Buka puasa is an Indonesian word, and it should be present / or added 
to that wordnet. If you are ever asked to tag a word like this there are two 
things you should do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write a comment stating that the concept is a foreign word.
    The comment should be standardised to the following form:
    <br> 'FW=ind'  (with the meaning "is a foreign word in indonesian")  
    <br>'FW=zsm', 'FW='cmn', FW='jpn' or 'FW='eng' are other likely 
    possibilities.
    
    <p>We want to be able to tell foreign words apart from other words.
    Usually they have a special POS, but that is often incorrect.
    This comment will allow us to find them all whenever we want.

  <li> concerning the tag, you should do one of two thing:
    <ul>
      <li> if you know how to and have previously used the corpus fixer 
	interface, (where we can correct tokenisation errors, create new 
	concepts, etc.) you should use that interface to manually tag 
	the concept with the correct synset (the one that has the lemma 
	in the foreign language).

      <li> if you never used this interface (or don't even know what 
	we're talking about), then you should tag it as 'e', but include 
	the FW comment along with the synset you think is the correct to 
	tag the word. This interface we're referring to is used to 
	correct things marked as 'e', so it will make someone's (maybe even 
	your) life easier later on.
    </ul>
</ul>


<h3><a name="extend">Extending wordnet<a></h3>

<p>Experienced annotators can have access to the wordnet editing
  interface (this is not the case for students annotating as part of a
  class project).

<p>Suggested changes to wordnet can be added to wordnet.
  <ul>
    <li> E.g.,  <i>laidback<sub>u</sub></i> is a synonym of
      "02408011-a: laid-back, mellow", so we
      add <i>laidback</i> as an English lemma  for the synset
    <li> E.g., <i>Python</i> is a hyponym of "06898352-n programming
      language", so we make a new lemma linked to
      <em>06898352-n</em> as a hyponym, and give it a name
      and English definition.   If possible add lemmas in other languages.
  </ul>
    </ul>
 
</ul>

<p><b>Don't forget to check for orthographic variants of existing
synsets first.</b>  E.g. <i>stir-fry</i> is in wordnet as <i>stir fry</i>,
then <i>stir-fry</i> should just be added to that synset
(<t>=00326459</t>).    

<hr>
<h3><a name="issues">Tagging Issues</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>A word can be in two multi-word expressions:
    <br>6740: <i>I lived in that farm , where I had a room down below , and could <u>get in and out</u> every night , and no one the wiser</i> 
    <br> tag as both <tt>get_in</tt> and <tt>get_out</tt>

  <li>What are some more examples of bad lemmas?
    <br>When the morphological analyzer has made an error:
    <ul>
      <li><i>well dressed man</i> <i><b>dressed</b></i> not  <i><b>dress</b></i>
      <li><i>Sherlock Holmes</i> <i><b>Sherlock_Holmes</b></i> not  <i><b>sherlock_holmes</b></i>
    </ul>
    In these cases, if you cand find an appropriate sense, 
    put it in the tag box, don't chose a Meta tag.
    <li>Common errors for English
      <ul>
	<li>adjective/past-participle: 
	  <i>dressed</i> <i><b>dressed|dress</b></i> 
	  <br>In general prefer adjective, then verb
	<li>adjective/present-participle/noun:
	  <i>dressing</i> <i><b>dressing|dress|dressing</b></i> 
	  <br>In general prefer adjective, then verb, then noun
	<li>plural noun/noun/adjective:
	  <i>goods</i> <i><b>goods|good|good</b></i> 
	  <i>woods</i> <i><b>woods|wood</b></i> 
	  <br>In general prefer adjective, then noun (if both senses are appropriate):
	  So, <i>damp</i> in <i>damp weather</i> is an
	  adjective, even though a noun sense exists. But nouns can pre-modify adjectives: 
	  <i>cotton</i> in <i>cotton shirts</i>is a noun.
	  <br>singular or plural normally has a meaning difference: pick the right meaning
      </ul>
      When there is a meaning difference, go with the closest meaning
    <li>Common  errors for Japanese/Chinese/Indonesian
      <ul>
	<li>There are a lot of tokenization errors
	<li>Sadly the wordnet often has bad entries
      </ul>

    <li>When does the system miss an entry?
      <ul>
	<li>Differences in spelling/hyphenization; errors in tokenization and lemmatization
	  <br><i>night bird</i>, <i>nightbird</i>, <i>night-bird</i>

<h2><a name="english">Detailed Guidelines for English</a></h2>

<p>These are based on
  the <a href='pics/tagging.guidelines_v2.pdf'>Guidelines for the Gloss
  Annotation Project</a>
  and the <a href='pics/tagging.cheatsheet.pdf'>Cheatsheet fof the Gloss

    <p> How to determine part of speech for the word/collocation. This
    is not always as obvious as it seems! There are four particularly
    tricky cases. These are all tricky because the part of speech of a
    word is not always the same as the grammatical function that the
    word is performing in the sentence or phrase. For instance, nouns
    can function similarly to what are traditionally called
    adjectives, and verbs can take on the roles of nouns or
    adjectives.

      <h3><a name="adj_n">Adjective vs. noun modifying a noun</a>  </h3>

<ul>
  <li><i><u>favorable</u> conditions are forecast</i>
  <li><i><u>damp</u> weather is behind us </i>
</ul>
And sometimes after the noun:
<ul>
    <li><i>conditions <u>unfavorable</u> for flying </i>
</ul>
Nouns can also serve as modifiers, similar to adjectives:
<ul>
    <li><i><u>entertainment</u> value</i>
    <li><i><u>children's</u> books</i>
    <li><i><u>cotton</u> shirts </i>
</ul>

<p>The general rule of thumb for deciding whether it is a noun or
adjective is to check the sense list first for whether there is an
adjective sense corresponding to the word, and, if not, then whether
there's a corresponding noun sense. So, <i>damp</i> in <i>damp weather</i> is an
adjective, even though a noun sense exists. And <i>cotton</i> in <i>cotton
shirts</i> is a noun, which is modifying another noun. 

If there is no adjective sense in WordNet, then you should make sure
that it is not truly an adjective that is missing from WordNet. A good
clue that you have an adjective is if you try to modify it with <i>very</i>
or <i>rather</i> and it sounds ok: <i>very/rather favorable conditions</i>
(ok) vs. <i>very/rather cotton shirts</i> (not ok). 

Another good clue is if you can make a comparative or superlative form
out of it (<i>damper/dampest/more favorable/most favorable
conditions</i> are all adjectives, but <i>cottoner/cottonest/more
cotton/most cotton shirts</i> are not).  If either of these tests come
up ok (that is, <i>very/rather x</i> sounds good or either 
<i>x-er/x-est</i> or <i>more/most x</i> sounds good), and there is no
matching adjective sense, then you need to <a href='#change'>add a new sense to wordnet</a>.

Note that these tests are only valid if they come up ok. Then you know
you have an adjective for sure. If the tests are not ok, then it may
still be an adjective. This is because the tests only work for certain
kinds of adjectives, but not all. If the tests are not ok (that is,
none of <i>very/rather x</i> and <i>x-er/x- est/more x/most x</i>
sound good), then check for a matching noun sense. If there is no
matching noun sense, then do not assign any sense. (But see 
below first regarding present and past participles, since it might be
a verb!). If a noun sense does exist, then the word can be considered
a noun, and be tagged to the noun sense.The noun-sense rule applies
only when the word is modifying a noun. If the word is being used
predicatively (that is, after some form of the verb <i>be</i>, or where
the verb could be replaced by a verb such as <i>seem, look, appear</i>, etc.) In the
predicative case, there may be some confusion as to whether what
follows the verb is an adjective or a noun. So, in
<ul>
    <li><i>the weather was <u>damp</u> </i>
</ul>

<p><i>damp</i> is an adjective here. Notice that you can replace <i>was</i>
with <i>seemed/looked/appeared</i> and still get a grammatical
sentence: <i>the weather seemed/looked/appeared damp</i>. But note the
difference between the pairs:
<ul>
    <li><i>he was <u>drunk</u></i> [pos = adjective]
    <li><i>he was really <u>drunk</u></i> [pos = adjective]
</ul>
and
<ul>
    <li><i>he was a <u>drunk</u></i> [pos = noun]</i>
    <li><i>he was obviously a <u>drunk</u></i> [pos = noun]
</ul>

<p>In the second pair, drunk is clearly a noun, not an adjective. It is
the complement of the verb <i>be</i> here. Two reliable ways to
recognize a noun are if it is (or can be) preceded by a determiner
(such as <i>a</i> or <i>the</i>) or adjective (he was a silly
drunk).  In summary: When you have the situation of <i>modifier noun</i>, the
modifier will be an adjective when there is a corresponding
adjective sense in WordNet for the meaning it is being used with OR
there is no corresponding adjective sense, but any of the tests come up ok (
very/rather (sounds good when you preface it with <i>very</i>
or <i>rather</i>) or –er/– est/more/most (x-er/x-est/more x/most x))
, in which case <i>Sense not in WordNet</i> should be
assigned.

<p>The modifier will be a noun when:
  <ul>
    <li>There is no corresponding adjective, and the very/rather and –er/–est/more x/most x tests are not ok, and a corresponding noun sense exists
  </ul>

<p>If it is neither an adjective nor a noun, it might be a verb (see  below)

<h3><a name="adj_ing">Adjective vs. present participle (-ing form) of
    verb</a></h3>

<p>The <i>-ing</i> form of verbs can function as adjectives. For instance,
<ul>
    <li><i>you are <u>frightening</u> me</i> [pos = verb]
    <li><i>that is a <u>frightening</u> prospect</i> [pos = adjective (modifier)]
    <li><i>that prospect is <u>frightening</u> to me</i> [pos = adjective (modifier)]
    <li><i>that prospect is <u>frightening</u> me</i> [pos = verb]
 </ul>
<ul>
    <li><i>we are <u>working</u> hard today [pos = verb]</i>
    <li><i>the car is in good <u>working</u> order </i>[pos = adjective/(modifier)] 
 </ul>

<p>How to tell? The easy case is when the word is modifying a noun. In
general, these are adjectives if there is a corresponding adjective
sense in WordNet. Such adjective senses exist for frightening and
working . However, this is not the case for <i>clicking</i>
and <i>playing</i>, so that in the following sentences,
<ul>
    <li><i>the door opened with a <u>clicking</u> sound</i>
    <li><i>the baseball player’s <u>playing</u> record was impeccable </i>
 </ul>
<p>the appropriate verb senses of <i>click</i> and <i>play</i> would
be selected instead. (This is because these are verbs playing the part
of adjectives, but are not adjectives in themselves.)  When the word
appears predicatively (after some form of the verb <i>be</i>), the rule
can't always be applied since it might be impossible to tell whether
it is being used as a verb or an adjective.
<ul>
    <li><i>That dress is <u>striking</u> on you [adjective]</i>
    <li><i>The workers are <u>striking</u> for better working conditions [verb]</i>
    <li><i>The women are <u>striking</u> [ambiguous] </i>
 </ul>

<p>Without more information, you cannot know whether the third
sentence means that the women are picketing, or whether they are
beautiful. For ambiguous cases like this, if the context does not make
it clear chose which you think is most appropriate and add a comment
saying that it is hard to tell.

<h3><a name="adj_en">Adjective vs. past participle (usually -en form)
    of verb</a></h3>

<p>Past tense participles can also function as adjectives. The past
tense participle is the form of the verb that appears with the past
tense auxiliary <i>have</i>. It usually, though not always, ends in
-en or -ed: <i>written</i>, <i>destroyed</i>, and <i>spun</i> are past
participles of <i>write, destroy and spin, respectively</i>.  The rule
of thumb will be similar to the present participle cases. Where the
word modifies a noun, check first for a corresponding adjective sense.

If no adjective sense exists, then assign the verb sense (if there is
one that matches the meaning as used in the sentence).
<ul>
  <li><i> that wasn’t the <u>intended</u> result</i> [adjective]
  <li><i>make out an <u>itemized</u> list</i> [verb functioning as modifier]
</ul>

<p> Again, the hard cases occur when the word appears predicatively (ie., after some form of the verb "to be", or where the preceding verb can be replaced by a verb such as seem/look/appear, etc.).
  <ul>
    <li><i>The sentence was <u>written</u> down for clarity.</i> [verb]
    <li><i>The sentence was <u>written</u> as opposed to spoken.</i> [adjective]
    <li><i>The sentence was <u>written</u></i> [ambiguous]
</ul>

<p>In the first sentence, <i>written</i> is a verb. A good test of this is
to put the auxiliary verb in the progressive – <i>The sentence WAS
BEING written down for clarity</i>. That makes it clear it is an act
or action that occurred. The second sentence cannot be phrased that
way and still have the same sense: <i>The sentence was being written
as opposed to spoken</i>.In the third sentence, it is not clear
whether "written" refers to an act of writing, or the attribute or
quality of being written. For ambiguous cases like this, do not assign
a sense, and the lexicographers will make the determination.


<h3><a name="n_ing">Noun vs. present participle (-ing form) of
    verb</a></h3>

<p>To complicate things further, the present participle of verbs can function as a
noun. Often, the distinction is easy to make, if it appears where a
noun is called for grammatically, and there is a corresponding noun
sense in WordNet.
<ul>
  <li><i>he made a <u>killing</u> in the stock market</i> [noun]
  <li><i> the discordant <u>ringing</u> of nonmusical metallic
objects</i> [noun]
</ul>

<p>If no noun sense exists, then assign the verb sense, if
one exists, as for
<ul>
  <li><i>The merry <u>frolicking</u> of the lark</i> [verb functioning as noun]
</ul>
<p>However, if the word is being used as a
verb, then a noun sense should never be assigned! This is easy if
there is no noun sense, as for <i>frolicking</i>
<ul>
  <li><i>the lark is given to <u>frolicking</u> merrily</i> [verb]
</ul>
or when it is obviously depicting an ongoing action
<ul>
  <li><i>make a sound like a car engine that is <u>firing</u> too soon</i> [verb]
</ul>

<p>You can test this out, too. A verb can
never be modified by <i>a</i> or <i>the</i> or a possessive pronoun such as
<i>my/your/our</i>, etc. Try it with the 2 sentences above--it hurts!
But, again, there will be cases where this determination will be
impossible to make
<ul>
  <li><i>She dislikes <u>writing</u> thank-you letters </i>[verb]
  <li><i>She had no knowledge of the <u>writing</u> of
      the letter</i> [noun] 
  <li><i>She had been talking about <u>writing</u></i> [ambiguous]

</ul>
<p>It is not clear whether <i>writing</i> in the 3rd sentence
refers to the act of writing something (eg, a letter), or whether
writing is the object itself (ie, her writing, or an author's writing,
marks on a piece of paper, etc.) For ambiguous cases like this, assign
a sense and comment on the difficulty.

<h3><a name="n_ed">Adjective+hyphen+inflected
    noun <i>long-legged</i>, <i>brown-eyed</i></a></h3>

<p>Tag the first word as JJ, surface form includes the hyphen, lemma does
not: <i>long-</i>, JJ <i>long</i>; <i>brown-</i>, JJ <i>brown</i>.  

<p>Tag the second word as NN, surface form includes the <i>ed</i>, lemma does
not: <i>legged</i>, NN <i>leg</i>;  <i>eyed</i>, NN <i>eye</i>.

If the compound is in wordnet, make a multi-word compund and use it (e.g <b><i>long-legged</i></b> is 
<a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc-unipi/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?gridmode=ntumcgrid&synset=02385851-a&lang=eng&lang2=eng'>02385851-a</a>).

<p>In any case, make two concepts for the original words, tagged as 'x'
for the multiword and tagged for each word otherwise.

<p>Similarly for <i>well-written</i> (Adv, verb)
and <i>odd-sounding</i>: split, lemma does not include hyphen.

<h3><a name="est">Irregular Comparatives/Superlatives</h3>

<p>Please tag comparatives and superlatives with their base form.
  So <i>better</i> is <i>good</i>, <i>least</i> is <i>less</i>, etc

<p>The fact that e.g. <i>wiser</i> means "more wise" is deducible from
  the POS tag (JJR: comparative), so just chose the most appropriate
  sense of <i>wise</i>
  
<h2><a name="relations">Using Wordnet Relations to determine sense (or
    senses)</a></h2>

<p>In WordNet, senses are in part defined by their relations to
other senses. For this reason, the WordNet relations can be very
useful in narrowing down which of the senses applies to a particular
occurrence of the form. The relations for any word or collocation can
be viewed through the WordNet browser.  From the WordNet entry of the
word you are tagging, clicking on one of the sense buttons
will display the full entry: you may want to middle click to open in a new tab.

<p> The main relations that are of help are Hypernyms, Derivationally
related forms, and Domain. Not all relations will appear for all words
and all parts of speech for a word.

  <h3><a name="hyp">Hypernym (ISA relation)</a></h3>

<p>The immediate hypernym is the most relevant one here. It is the first indented
relation just below the definition (preceded by an arrow =>). The
hypernym relation will tell you what kind of thing (object or action)
the word refers to. The higher up you go in the hypernym relations,
the more general the senses get (and so often less informative). There
is a new indentation for each level up you go. For instance, two
senses of the noun center that are rather close are 
<ul>
  <li>A: <i>center, centre, middle, heart, eye</i> -- (an area that is
approximately central within some larger region; "it is in the center
of town"; "they ran forward into the heart of the struggle"; "they
were in the eye of the storm")
  <li>B: <i>center, centre, midpoint</i> -- (a
point equidistant from the ends of a line or the extremities of a
figure)
</ul>
If you look at the hypernyms for the noun senses
of <i>center</i>, you can see that Sense A is an area while Sense B is
a point, what they have in common is a notion of centrality. Both are
at some level locations, and eventually all nouns are entities (so
that knowing that something is a kind of entity is not of much help at
all!).

<!-- Sense 1center, centre, middle, heart, eye -- (an area that is -->
<!-- approximately central within some larger region; "it is in the center -->
<!-- of town"; "they ran forward into the heart of the struggle"; "they -->
<!-- were in the eye of the storm")=> area, country -- (a particular geographical -->
<!-- region of indefinite boundary (usually serving some special purpose or -->
<!-- distinguished by its people or culture or geography); "it was a -->
<!-- mountainous area"; "Bible country")=> region -- (a large indefinite -->
<!-- location on the surface of the Earth; "penguins inhabit the polar -->
<!-- regions")=> location -- (a point or extent in space)=> object, -->
<!-- physical object -- (a tangible and visible entity; an entity that can -->
<!-- cast a shadow; "it was full of rackets, balls and other objects")=> -->
<!-- physical entity -- (an entity that has physical existence)=> entity -- -->
<!-- (that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct -->
<!-- existence (living or nonliving))Sense 4center, centre, midpoint -- (a -->
<!-- point equidistant from the ends of a line or the extremities of a -->
<!-- figure)=> point -- (the precise location of something; a spatially -->
<!-- limited location; "she walked to a point where she could survey the -->
<!-- whole street")=> location -- (a point or extent in space)=> object, -->
<!-- physical object -- (a tangible and visible entity; an entity that can -->
<!-- cast a shadow; "it was full of rackets, balls and other objects")=> -->
<!-- physical entity -- (an entity that has physical existence)=> entity -- -->
<!-- (that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct -->
<!-- existence (living or nonliving)) -->

<!-- <h3>Derivationally related forms (related words in different parts of speech)</h3> -->

<!-- <p>The verb cut has 41 senses, quite a -->
<!-- lot to slog through each time you tag a verb. Good use of the -->
<!-- derivational links (where they apply) can give you a shortcut through -->
<!-- all those senses and do the selecting for you. Pretty nice, but how? -->

<!-- <p> If you look at the derivational links (the ⊳ pointer) for the -->
<!-- verb <i>cut</i>, you will see that 7 of the 41 senses are related to -->
<!-- senses of the nouns cutter and cutting. In particular, notice that -->
<!-- only one sense is related to the noun <i>cutter</i> (it’s related to 2 senses -->
<!-- of cutter, the sense of the person who cuts, and the tool that does -->
<!-- the cutting). -->
<!-- <pre> -->
<!-- Sense 1cut -- (separate with or as if with an instrument; -->
<!-- "Cut the rope") RELATED TO->(noun) cutter#3=> cutter -- (someone whose -->
<!-- work is cutting (as e.g. cutting cloth for garments)) RELATED -->
<!-- TO->(noun) cutter#6=> cutter, cutlery, cutting tool -- (a cutting -->
<!-- implement; a tool for cutting) RELATED TO->(noun) cutting#3=> cut, -->
<!-- cutting -- (the act of cutting something into parts; "his cuts were -->
<!-- skillful"; "his cutting of the cake made a terrible mess") -->

<!-- <p>At some point in the tagging, you will get to the gloss for each of these -->
<!-- nouns (since they each have some form of cut in their -->
<!-- definitions). Since you know that sense #1 of the verb cut is related -->
<!-- to sense #3 of the noun cutter (the first relation under cut), then -->
<!-- when you are tagging the gloss, you can simply assign sense #1 of the -->
<!-- verb cut to both occurrences of the verb <i>cutting</i>, without -->
<!-- having to look further. -->

<h3><a name="dom">Domain</a></h3>
<p>Is this term restricted to one topic or area or field
or context?

<p>Where they exist, the domain relations can be quite helpful in
narrowing senses down. A word’s domain will tell you whether it is
restricted to some field or area such as Law or Art. Take the
noun <i>work</i>. It has 7 senses, and if you look at its domains, you
can see that one of its senses is restricted to the domain of physics,
having to do with the transfer of energy.

<!-- Sense 5work -- ((physics) a manifestation of -->
<!-- energy; the transfer of energy from one physical system to another -->
<!-- expressed as the product of a force and the distance through which it -->
<!-- moves a body in the direction of that force; "work equals force times -->
<!-- distance")CATEGORY->(noun) physics#1, physical science#1, natural -->
<!-- philosophy#1When tagging the form work, at some point the gloss for -->
<!-- energy will appear, since it contains the word <i>work</i>:energy -- -->
<!-- (the capacity of a physical system to do work; the units of energy are -->
<!-- joules or ergs;)This sense of energy is also in the domain of -->
<!-- physics. That can be seen by the Domain line just below the Find box -->
<!-- in the Mantag interface. The domain for the gloss you are tagging -->
<!-- appears on that line. So it is very likely (and in this case, quite -->
<!-- true) that the sense of work in the gloss above is the sense from -->
<!-- physics.9 -->
